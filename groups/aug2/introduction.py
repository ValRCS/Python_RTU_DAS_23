# by default we print to standard output - we can change that later

# we write comments for humans not computers - computers ignore comments
# comments should clarify intent - why are we doing something

# let's try to break some things
print("hmmmm")
# we can print Latvian
print("Varu stāstīt un rakstīt Latviski par runčiem un kaķiem..")
# Python 3 has full Unicode support
# I can put text in any language
# I can use Emoji even

# simple arithmetic
print(2+2)
# compare
print("2+2") # this is text string
#
print(10-3)
print(7*10) # * for multiplication
print(10/4) # so / returns division
print(10//4) # gives you whole (integer) result
# very import is reminder (similar to modulo)
print(20%7) # we use reminder quite a bit for example for odd or even
# when reminder of division of 2
print(10%2,11%2,12%2,13%2)


# notice we used , to separate results
print("When I calculate 2*2 I get", 2*2) # , by default will give you one space

# we can add strings together as well
print("Valdis likes to" + " teach") # string concatenation

# we can multiply strings with numbers!
print("Beer"*5)
print("All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\n"*3)
# notice \n that stands for newline

# ** we can use it to raise to power
print(2**8) # so 8 bits come into 1 byte whichs
# can hold 256 different values
# 16 bit
print(2**16)
# 24 bit color is..
print("24 bit color can hold this many different values", 2**24)
# 32 bit system memory limit
print("32 bit computers can easily acces this many mmeory bits", 2**32)
# so 64 bits to rescue
print("64 bit addresses have plenty of space", 2**64)

# normal parenthesis for math
print("(2+2)*(3+7) is.", (2+2)*(3+7))
